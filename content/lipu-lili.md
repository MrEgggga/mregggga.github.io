# lipu lili

lipu lili is a pair of reference books for toki pona. they are not intended 
for learning toki pona (although i won't stop you), but rather for referring to 
if you forget something.

these books were made with XeTeX and [8up-zine by polychora-org](https://github.com/polychora-org/8up-zine).

## how to print these books

each of these books can be printed on a single sheet of paper and then cut and folded into a book. simply follow these instructions:

note that some PDF viewers' (such as Firefox's) print dialogs will automatically add a margin that can't be removed. Google Chrome seems to work, as well as Preview (on Mac) and GIMP. image versions are provided in case your PDF viewer doesn't work.
